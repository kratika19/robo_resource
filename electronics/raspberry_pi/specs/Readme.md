This is how a Raspberry Pi looks like

- **USB ports** — these are used to connect a mouse and keyboard. You can also connect other components, such as a USB drive.

- **SD card slot** — you can slot the SD card in here. This is where the operating system software and your files are stored.

- **Ethernet port** — this is used to connect Raspberry Pi to a network with a cable. Raspberry Pi can also connect to a network via wireless LAN.

- **Audio jack** — you can connect headphones or speakers here.

- **HDMI port** — this is where you connect the monitor (or projector) that you are using to display the output from the Raspberry Pi. If your monitor has speakers, you can also use them to hear sound.

- **Micro USB power connector** — this is where you connect a power supply. You should always do this last, after you have connected all your other components.

- **GPIO ports** — these allow you to connect electronic components such as LEDs and buttons to Raspberry Pi.

GPIO pins are arguably one of the most powerful features of the board.A 40-pin GPIO header is found on all current Raspberry Pi boards (unpopulated on Pi Zero and Pi Zero W).

</br>
Any of the GPIO pins can be designated (in software) as an input or output pin and used for a wide range of purposes.

So we understood the basic structure of Raspberry Pi , but how are we gonna use it :question:

Well , then my question is

How do we use a PC :question:

.

.

.

.

**An Operating System**

The same is required for a Raspberry Pi.It runs the official Lunix distro called *Raspbian*.Various other operating systems can be used on Pi like RISC, Kodi Media Center, Ubuntu Mate and classroom management.In fact you can even run your own Windows 10 on it. How cool :sunglasses::sunglasses:

So lets setup :electric_plug: this mini PC try some awesome stuff with it. :computer:
