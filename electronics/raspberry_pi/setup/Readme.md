Let’s connect up your Raspberry Pi and get it running.

- Check the slot on the underside of your Raspberry Pi and insert an SD card with Raspbian installed ([via NOOBS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/noobs.md)).
- Connect the mouse and keyboard to a USB port on your Raspberry Pi (it doesn’t matter which port you use).
- Make sure your Monitor is plugged into a wall socket and switched on and connect it to the Raspberry Pi’s HDMI port.(*Two screens support provided in Raspberry Pi 4*)

     **Note**: nothing will display on the screen, because the Raspberry Pi is not running yet.
- If you want to connect the Pi to the internet via Ethernet, use an Ethernet cable to connect the Ethernet port on the Raspberry Pi to an Ethernet socket.(You can also use Wi-Fi present on the Pi for it)
- Plug the power supply into a socket and then connect it to your Raspberry Pi’s USB power port
- You should see a red light on your Raspberry Pi and raspberries on the monitor.Your Raspberry Pi then boots up into a graphical desktop    
:tada: :tada: And you see a screen similar to that generated by your 30 pound PC.

- A pop-up will appear and follow the step by step instructions to setup your PC and then it will reboot.
- Your setup is complete now and you are free to play around with your new PC.
- It will be quite easy to work with it if you are familiar with linux , if not [*this*](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-getting-started/5) would be helpful.

- If you’re having problems with your Raspberry Pi, there are lots of places you can get help and advice
