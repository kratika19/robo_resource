* [ Hands–On ML With Scikit–Learn, Keras and TensorFlow By Aurélien Géron : ](https://www.pdfdrive.com/hands-on-machine-learning-with-scikit-learn-and-tensorflow-concepts-tools-and-techniques-to-build-intelligent-systems-e168440497.html)
This is one of the most popular books in the ML community.  Author, Aurelian Geron, a former Googler who led YouTube’s video classification team from 2013 to 2016, uses concrete examples in this practical book to present readers with a guide on how to use production-ready Python frameworks such as Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow.

* [Introduction to Machine Learning with Python :](https://www.pdfdrive.com/introduction-to-machine-learning-with-python-e58337749.html)
If you’re just getting started with Machine Learning definitely read this book.
.
Introduction to Machine Learning with Python is a gentle introduction into machine learning. It doesn’t assume any knowledge about Python and it introduces fundamental concepts and applications of machine learning, discussing various methods through examples. That’s the best book I’ve ever seen for an entry level Machine Learning Engineer.

Python Machine Learning is just a great practical book with a lot of actual examples of code. It starts gently and then proceeds to most recent advance in machine learning and deep learning. It’s very easy to read and will appeal to people at any level as the second edition even goes to cover GANs.

* [Programming Collective Intelligence : ](https://www.pdfdrive.com/programming-collective-intelligence-e6432369.html)
The Programming Collective Intelligence is less of an introduction to machine learning and more of a guide for implementing ml. The book details on creating efficient ml algorithms for gathering data from applications, creating programs for accessing data from websites, and inferring the gathered data. Each chapter features exercises for extending the stated algorithms and further improve their efficiency and effectiveness.
* [ Natural Language Processing with Python : ](https://www.pdfdrive.com/natural-language-processing-with-python-e1251452.html)
Natural language processing is the backbone of machine learning systems. The Natural Language Processing with Python book uses the Python programming language to guide you into using NLTK, the popular suite of Python libraries and programs for symbolic and statistical natural language processing for English and NLP in general.

* [Machine Learning for Absolute Beginners: A Plain English Introduction ](ihsjv)
Have no prior experience and exposure to machine learning? But still, want to learn it? Then you must not miss out on the Machine Learning for Absolute Beginners book by Oliver Theobald. Obviously, no coding or mathematical background is required to benefit from this machine learning book.
* [Deep Learning for Computer Vision with Python : ](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1SgSF_NIB1EecPA6Bnu7VrqRjbP1uLtmb)
This book is a great, in-depth dive into practical deep learning for computer vision. I found it to be an approachable and enjoyable read: explanations are clear and highly detailed. You’ll find many practical tips and recommendations that are rarely included in other books or in university courses.

* [Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow : ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320703571_Ian_Goodfellow_Yoshua_Bengio_and_Aaron_Courville_Deep_learning_The_MIT_Press_2016_800_pp_ISBN_0262035618)
The fundamental concepts of DL are thoroughly explained in this book from scratch, for a stronger foothold in the domain. The book explains relevant concepts of Linear Algebra, Probability and Information Theory, Numerical Computation, industry-standard techniques such as Optimization Algorithms, Convolutional Networks, Computer Vision, and research topics such as Monte Carlo methods, Partition Function. Sufficient supplementary material is bundled for a deeper understanding.
